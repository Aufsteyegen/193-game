## What is this?

A React-three-fiber based webgame to challenge your geography knowledge! Choose the correct country outline from a set of four outlines based on a given flag.

A 60-second timer starts once ``play`` or the ``1`` key is pressed. If the correct outline is chosen on the first guess, your streak will increase by one and five seconds will be added to the timer. The timer will never exceed 60 seconds.

## Controls

- Press the ``play`` button or the ``1`` key to start. 
- Press the ``1`` key or the ``'A'`` key to pick the first (i.e., leftmost) country. To select the neighboring country to the right of the first one, press the "2" key or the "S" key. Keys ``3`` and ``D`` will select the third country, and keys ``4`` and ``F`` will select the fourth.
