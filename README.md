## What is this?
---
A React-three-fiber based webgame to challenge your geography knowledge. Given
a flag, pick the corresponding country outline from four outlines.

A sixty-second timer starts once [play] or the [1] key is pressed. If the correct outline is chosen on the first guess, your streak will increase by one and five seconds will be added to the timer (which will never exceed 60 seconds). 

## Controls
---
- Press the [play] button or the [1] key to start. 
- Press the [1] key or the ['A'] key to pick the first (i.e., leftmost) country. Press the [2] key or the ['S'] key to pick the neighboring country to the right of the first. Etc.
